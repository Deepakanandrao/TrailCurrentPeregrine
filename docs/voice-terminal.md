# Voice terminal endpoint (`/api/voice`)

An additional HTTP endpoint on `peregrine-chat.service` that lets a **dumb
remote device** (an ESP32-P4 with a mic + speaker, a browser tab, an MQTT
bridge — anything that can POST a WAV) act as a push-to-talk terminal for
the Peregrine LLM. No wake word required — the client decides when to
capture and when to send.

The first consumer is the CrowPanel Advance ESP32-P4 10.1" HMI (see
`YouTubeCodeSamples/elecrow-esp32-p4-10-in/` in the sibling repo).

## What the endpoint does

Runs the same pipeline the on-board voice loop does, but as a single HTTP
request/response:

```
POST /api/voice   (audio/wav upload, ~16 kHz mono S16LE)
  │
  ├─▶ faster-whisper (base.en, INT8) ── transcript
  │
  ├─▶ 127.0.0.1:11435/api/intent   ── canned answer? use it and skip LLM
  │       │
  │       └── no match ──▶ /api/enrich (add "you are in <city>" if relevant)
  │                             │
  │                             └──▶ genie-server /api/chat (Llama 3.2 1B on NPU)
  │                                       │
  │                                       └── if JSON emitted, run through
  │                                           /api/command (device control),
  │                                           use spoken confirmation as reply
  │
  ├─▶ Piper TTS (en_US-libritts_r-medium, 22.05 kHz output)
  │
  └─▶ audioop.ratecv resample to 16 kHz mono S16LE
          │
          ▼
   audio/wav response
   + X-Peregrine-Transcript header (URL-encoded)
   + X-Peregrine-Response   header (URL-encoded)
```

Everything runs in the `peregrine-chat.service` process, in the same venv
that `voice-assistant.service` already uses.

## Security model

- Plain HTTP, not HTTPS. The endpoint is intended for LAN-only clients that
  can't practically ship the self-signed CA the browser UI uses. Trust
  boundary is "already on the LAN with the LLM box".
- Bearer token required on every request. When `PEREGRINE_VOICE_TOKEN` is
  empty the endpoint stays closed (`[voice] endpoint disabled` in the
  journal) — that's the safe default.
- Token comparison uses `hmac.compare_digest` (constant-time).

## Setup — enable the endpoint on a running board

Do this AFTER a normal `./deploy.sh peregrine.local` has landed the current
`src/` (which includes `stt.py` alongside `assistant.py`, `tts.py`,
`web_chat.py`).

```bash
# ── 1. On your workstation: generate + save the shared token ──────────────
openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/.peregrine-voice-token
chmod 600 ~/.peregrine-voice-token

# ── 2. Install the token as a systemd drop-in on the board ────────────────
# Expand the substitution locally so it ends up as a literal in the
# heredoc — if you SSH first and then run $(cat …) you'll cat a file that
# only exists on your workstation, and the token will silently become "".
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.peregrine-voice-token | tr -d '\n')
ssh -t trailcurrent@peregrine.local "
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/peregrine-chat.service.d &&
  printf '[Service]\nEnvironment=PEREGRINE_VOICE_TOKEN=%s\n' '$TOKEN' |
    sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/peregrine-chat.service.d/voice.conf > /dev/null &&
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload &&
  sudo systemctl restart peregrine-chat.service &&
  sleep 3 &&
  sudo journalctl -u peregrine-chat.service -n 10 --no-pager | grep -E 'voice|listening'
"
```

Expected journal output:

```
[voice] listening on http://0.0.0.0:8081 (target_sr=16000, max_bytes=1048576)
[web-chat] HTTPS listening on https://0.0.0.0:443 (cert=…)
[web-chat] HTTP redirector on :80 → HTTPS (also serves /ca.pem unencrypted)
```

If instead you see `[voice] endpoint disabled (PEREGRINE_VOICE_TOKEN unset)`,
the drop-in didn't take — most likely the `$TOKEN` substitution was empty
(see gotcha below).

## Verifying — curl round-trip

```bash
# ── Make a valid 16 kHz mono S16LE test WAV (pure sine — Whisper will
#    return empty transcript and the endpoint will respond with the
#    "I didn't catch that." fallback, which still exercises the whole
#    STT → intent → TTS → resample chain).
python3 -c "
import wave, math, struct
sr = 16000
frames = [int(30000*math.sin(2*math.pi*300*t/sr)) for t in range(3*sr)]
with wave.open('/tmp/what-time.wav','wb') as w:
    w.setnchannels(1); w.setsampwidth(2); w.setframerate(sr)
    w.writeframes(b''.join(struct.pack('<h', f) for f in frames))
"

# ── POST it and grab the reply ────────────────────────────────────────────
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.peregrine-voice-token | tr -d '\n')
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: audio/wav" \
     --data-binary @/tmp/what-time.wav \
     -D /tmp/reply-headers.txt -o /tmp/reply.wav \
     -w "http_code=%{http_code} time=%{time_total}s size=%{size_download}B\n" \
     http://peregrine.local:8081/api/voice
cat /tmp/reply-headers.txt
file /tmp/reply.wav          # → RIFF … WAVE audio, 16-bit mono 16000 Hz
aplay /tmp/reply.wav
```

Expected: `http_code=200`, ~30 KB WAV, `X-Peregrine-Response:
I%20didn%27t%20catch%20that.`, ~4–5 sec round trip.

For a real speech test, record on the workstation (`arecord -f S16_LE -c1
-r16000 -d5 real.wav`) and POST that instead.

## Environment variables

Set in `peregrine-chat.service` (see [`config/peregrine-chat.service`](../config/peregrine-chat.service)):

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PEREGRINE_VOICE_PORT` | `8081` | LAN listener. Change if it clashes. |
| `PEREGRINE_VOICE_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | **Required**. Empty disables the endpoint. |
| `PEREGRINE_VOICE_MAX_BYTES` | `1048576` | 1 MB cap on upload body. ~30 sec of 16 kHz mono. |
| `PEREGRINE_VOICE_TARGET_SR` | `16000` | Output sample rate. Match the client codec. |
| `PIPER_MODEL` | `~/piper-voices/en_US-libritts_r-medium.onnx` | Voice for the reply. |
| `WHISPER_SIZE` | `base.en` | Model size. Match what's installed for `assistant.py`. |
| `CPU_THREADS` | `8` | Q6A has 8 cores — use them all for STT. |

The service uses the **assistant venv Python**
(`/home/trailcurrent/assistant-env/bin/python3`) because faster-whisper and
piper live there. `web_chat.py` was stdlib-only before this endpoint;
switching to the venv is purely additive.

## Gotchas (things that already broke us once)

**1. Heredoc `$(cat ~/.peregrine-voice-token)` expands on the wrong host.**

If you SSH into Peregrine and *then* write the drop-in:

```bash
ssh trailcurrent@peregrine.local
sudo tee /etc/…/voice.conf <<EOF
[Service]
Environment=PEREGRINE_VOICE_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.peregrine-voice-token)   # ← expands ON PEREGRINE
EOF
```

…the substitution runs against Peregrine's home dir, which doesn't have
the file, so the value becomes empty and the endpoint stays disabled. The
journal shows `[Service]\nEnvironment=PEREGRINE_VOICE_TOKEN=` with a bare
trailing `=` — that's the tell.

Fix: expand `TOKEN` locally first, then interpolate into the ssh command
(the setup block above does this correctly).

**2. `deploy.sh` doesn't restart services.**

By design — the tail of `deploy.sh` prints the restart command instead of
running it, so an operator can eyeball the changes first. After a deploy
that touches `web_chat.py` or `peregrine-chat.service`, you still need:

```bash
ssh -t trailcurrent@peregrine.local sudo systemctl restart peregrine-chat.service
```

**3. `web_chat.py` runs under the venv, not system Python.**

If you see `[voice] pipeline error: No module named 'faster_whisper'`,
`ExecStart` still points at `/usr/bin/python3`. Point it at
`/home/trailcurrent/assistant-env/bin/python3` (already the default in the
committed unit).

**4. `X-Peregrine-Transcript` / `X-Peregrine-Response` are URL-encoded.**

HTTP header values can't carry newlines or non-ASCII cleanly, so both
headers are `urllib.parse.quote`d. Decode on the client side:

```bash
python3 -c "import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.unquote('$(grep -i X-Peregrine-Response /tmp/reply-headers.txt | cut -d: -f2- | tr -d ' \r\n')'))"
```

## Files

- [`src/web_chat.py`](../src/web_chat.py) — the `VoiceHandler` class + listener wiring
- [`src/stt.py`](../src/stt.py) — reusable `STTEngine` wrapping faster-whisper
- [`src/tts.py`](../src/tts.py) — `TTSEngine.render_to_wav_bytes()` synthesizes without aplay
- [`config/peregrine-chat.service`](../config/peregrine-chat.service) — env vars + venv Python path
- [`deploy.sh`](../deploy.sh) — copies all four files above to the running board

## Extending

- **Streaming response**: today the endpoint is unary (full WAV back in one
  response). Chunked `Transfer-Encoding` + on-the-fly Piper output could cut
  first-audio latency in half. Not needed for the CrowPanel MVP.
- **Multi-turn context**: the endpoint treats each request as a fresh
  single-turn message. If you want conversation memory the client can
  maintain a history and POST a JSON envelope wrapping the WAV (or a
  separate `X-Peregrine-History` header).
- **Alternative voices**: any Piper `.onnx` in `~/piper-voices/` — set
  `PIPER_MODEL` in the drop-in.
